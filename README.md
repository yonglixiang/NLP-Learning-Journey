## Overview
This repository is a collection of notes and code exercises related to NLP. My aim is to gain a deep understanding of NLP techniques, ranging from basic text processing to advanced deep learning models.

## Goals
- To read and summarize key NLP papers
- To implement NLP techniques and models
- To create a resource for others interested in learning NLP
